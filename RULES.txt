CHALLENGE RULES:
1. You may create and modify any files within the 'rockbot/' folder or in
sub-folders of the 'rockbot/' folder.
2. You may NOT create or modify any files in this project that are outside
the 'rockbot/' folder. However, these files may be updated by changes to the
upstream Git repository.
3. Use of tools or libraries to access or modify the game's internal state
is NOT ALLOWED.
4. The program may NOT run external programs (i.e. via os.system() or
subprocess.Popen()).
5. External Python libraries are allowed, with the following restrictions:
  5.a. They must follow the above rules.
  5.b. They must be publicly available, or must be made publicly available
  by you. If this is not possible (i.e. due to legal reasons), that
  library is NOT ALLOWED.
  5.c. You must make a list of which external libraries your program uses,
  along with how to retrieve them from the internet (or with Pip). This
  list must be in plain, human-readable text and should be placed in
  this folder. If a library has automatically-installed dependencies, these
  dependencies do not need to be listed.
