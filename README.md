# Rockbot Challenge

Write programs to detect, pathfind to, and collect rocks on a simulated field.

### Dependencies
To run this program, you will need Python 3 along wthe following libraries
(which can be installed via Pip):
* OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
* Numpy  (pip install numpy)
* Pygame (pip install pygame)
* Pillow (pip install pillow)

### How to use
* Clone this repository and ensure that you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
  * If you want to collaborate with a team on this project, fork the repository
  and have your other team members clone off of your fork. Make sure to give
  everyone in your team permission to contribute to your repository.
* Open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
* If the field shows up properly, everything is installed. Close the window and
continue.
* Your programs should be placed in the `rockbot` folder. The simulator will call
the `run()` function in the `run.py` file in that folder.
* To test your programs, simply run `main.py` again.
